&lt;p>In this post, we will look at the second step of path to production, the version control system, and the advantages and best practices around using tools like &lt;a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Development Environment</title><link>https://lanziani.com/posts/2023/03/local-development-environment/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2023 23:20:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://lanziani.com/posts/2023/03/local-development-environment/</guid><description>&lt;p>The first step of the Path to Production starts from our development environment, as the rest of the stages it changed quite a lot in the last ten years.&lt;/p>
